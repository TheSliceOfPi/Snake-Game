------------Snake Game------------
Snake Game is a simple game. The user objective is to "eat" the colorful treat. Once the user eats the treat their snake grows and changed into the color of the last item they ate. If the user ends up accidentally "eating" himself, their length restarts. They can keep track of how many treats they have eaten since they began (or restarted) and the max score of their current game session.
